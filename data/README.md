# Data

The images in this directory are the training data for your model.

🐕 Remove the cute puppy images and replace them with your own images.

## Guidelines

- Images can be in JPEG or PNG format.
- Dimensions and size don't matter.
- Filenames don't matter.
- Images can be of yourself, your pet, your favorite stuffed animal, or any unique object. For best results, your images should contain only the subject itself, with a minimum of background noise or other objects.
- Use a minimum of three images, but the model will tend to produce better results if you train it with more images, around 10-20.
- Do not use images of other people without their consent.
